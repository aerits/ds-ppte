# port of ppte to 3ds
- regular ppte repo at https://github.com/aerits/buyo
- can you compile this?
    - no
    - i have modified citro3d-sys and citro2d-sys (https://git.sr.ht/~sheepy/citro2d-rs) to make them compile because they didn't compile for me.
- the repo is filled with unsafe because im just using citro2d-sys because im too lazy to figure out sheepy's safe wrapper that i have git cloned
